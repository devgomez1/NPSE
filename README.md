Hi, welcome to our project, the NPSE website! 

Our site is dedicated to sports. We only have 2 sport pages created so far, so we are clearly in the early stages of development. However, we believe that what has been created on each of these two pages shows the potential our site has. Of course, we'd have to work on our name - ESPN probably wouldn't like it. 

We have 3 pages - our home component (the 'default' webpage), nba component (basketball!) and f1 component (racing!). In the future, we'll add more sports - but for now we're sure you get the idea.

On the f1 page, you can see season recaps for each of the past 6 F1 seasons. You can also read some recent articles at the bottom of the page, as well as post your thoughts about different seasons.

On the nba page, you can see an overview for the past 6 nba seasons, as well as search up team records from each individual season. There is also a feature to search up nba games by date (uses a public API). There is also a comment feature at the bottom of the page.
